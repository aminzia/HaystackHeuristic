# HaystackHeuristic
Example Code for Carrying out the Haystack Heuristic on Sample Immunological Data, as described in "A Haystack Heuristic for Autoimmune Disease Biomarker Discovery in Next-Gen Immune Repertoire Sequencing Data" (Apeltsin, et al.)

## Requirements
Python 2.7 or higher and Numpy ('http://www.numpy.org/')

## Sample Data
The immunological data stored in the 'example_patient_files' directory has been artificially generated and does in no way reflect the actual data used in the Haystack Heuristic paper.
